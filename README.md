Plant Care Calendar  

This is a program to help users keep track of the dates their plants need care. 
The user is prompted to enter information about a plant they would like to add. 
After this information is entered, they are prompted to enter another plant if they desire. 
This is repeated until the user decides to ‘quit’ or stop entering plants. 
At this time the program will print the information for each plant including the start date of the care and then then next 8 dates of care the plant needs. 
After this is printed the user is asked if they would like to edit any of the plants, if they elect to do so they can provide the original name of the plant they would like to edit and then edit the care instructions for it. 
After this the program will ask the user if they would like to delete any of the plants, if the user elects to delete a plant the entry will be removed from the calendar. 
The calendar will be printed again with any updates/edits made.
